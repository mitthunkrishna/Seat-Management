# Seat-Management
This seat management system helps us in finding whether there are available seats in the auditorium built as a prototype for our college need. This IR sensor senses the person is seating in a chair or not and this is done with the help of firebase real-time database which redirects to the app built for this to reflect , which helps us to find whether there is space or not in the auditorium.


To get the app you may have to visit : github.com/YajithVishwa and look out for the app in seat management project
